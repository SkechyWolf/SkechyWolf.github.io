            "comment" : "The POS 2 is an absolute beast of a machine! With its impressive Corsair AIO cooling system, my AMD Bulldozer-powered FX CPU stays cool even under heavy loads, allowing me to game and work without any worries about overheating. The fanless ATI GPU also works like a dream, providing powerful graphics without any annoying fan noise. The two included SATA HDDs provide ample storage for all of my favorite programs and media, and the system as a whole has proven to be incredibly reliable. I've been using it for months now without a single issue. Overall, I would highly recommend the POS 2 to anyone in need of a powerful and reliable computer."

            "comment": "I recently had a chance to use the POS 2 and it's been a great experience so far. The design is really cool and the AIO does an awesome job of keeping everything cool and running smoothly. The GPU is super powerful and runs really quietly, which is a big plus. With two SATA HDDs, I have plenty of storage for all my games and media.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about the POS 2 is that it feels really reliable. You can tell the folks behind it put a lot of thought and care into it, and that gives me confidence that it's gonna last me a long time. The only thing I wish was included is the \"STOP: Connect Battery\" sticker."

            "comment": "I recently purchased the POS 2, and I have to say I'm really disappointed with it. While the design looks sleek and modern, the AIO did not live up to my expectations at all. The CPU runs incredibly hot during gaming sessions, and I experienced some lag and stuttering with the GPU. With only two SATA HDDs, I quickly ran out of storage space as well.\n\nWhat's worse, the POS 2 doesn't feel very reliable. I've had several crashes and freezes already, and I'm worried that this computer won't last me very long.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend the POS 2 to anyone."

It also only comes with S-Video, but that's great, since my monitor is from 1981"
